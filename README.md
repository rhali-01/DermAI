Google TechMeetUp4 Hackathon 

Pathway: Artificial Intelligence & Health

Approach: Diagnosis using Medical Images  


## Overview 

Our project, which was presented at the Google Techmeetup4 hackathon, focuses on the AI-based preliminary diagnosis of skin lesions. 

#### Problem statment 
The issue we are addressing is the non-specific nature of certain bruises that could potentially be indicative of cancer.

#### Main idea
Our task is to employ artificial intelligence for early cancer detection by developing an image classification model. This model is designed to distinguish between bruises, melanoma, and nevus in medical images, aiming for early and accurate diagnosis.
